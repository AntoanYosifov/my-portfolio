Hi, I’m Antoan Yosifov, a software developer specializing in backend development (Java/Spring), with a strong interest in mastering front-end technologies. I recently shipped BrainDissecting, a web platform designed for discovering and moderating scientific articles, and I’m currently developing JobPilot, an innovative AI-powered job application tracker. Soon, I'll be diving into Angular to sharpen my front-end skills, further expanding my capabilities as a full-stack developer.

My journey into software development reflects dedication and resilience: for two years, I balanced a full-time job while studying programming intensively during evenings at Software University (SoftUni). During this challenging yet enriching period, I received an offer for a promotion at work, but I chose instead to leave that secure position behind in pursuit of my true passion—coding and software development.

Today, alongside continuous learning and project development, I am committed to mastering the German language—another demanding but rewarding journey that highlights my dedication to personal and professional growth. Navigating both language acquisition and complex programming concepts simultaneously underscores my drive and ability to manage significant challenges effectively.

I firmly believe in perseverance and hard work. My story so far has taught me that determination and genuine passion pave the way to success. I’m confident that I will achieve my goals—I simply need the opportunity to demonstrate my potential.
