Hi, I’m Antoan Yosifov — a Junior Software Engineer, backend-leaning by default (Java/Spring, databases), and actively growing into full-stack with TypeScript/Angular.

Over the last three years I’ve been based in Austria, working full-time while completing SoftUni’s Software Engineering program and consistently achieving high grades across modules. That combination taught me something recruiters don’t see in a tech stack: steady execution under pressure and deadlines — adapting to a new country, improving my German, and still shipping projects.

BrainDissecting was my first app: a Java/Spring server-rendered site integrating the DOAJ API, built around backend fundamentals.

TravelHub came next: an Angular + Firebase real-time app with authentication, strict ownership rules, and a reactive, responsive UI.

Most recently, my capstone project, House of Chaos, is a full-stack e-commerce platform for antique furniture, built with an Angular client, a Spring Boot REST API, and a separate Spring Boot microservice for product reviews.

On the backend I implemented stateless JWT authentication with a refresh token flow, role-based access (admin/user), robust validation and exception handling, and seamless integration between services.

On the frontend I built a production-style Angular app with guarded flows, reactive forms, interceptors (including a refresh mechanism that avoids duplicate refresh requests), and UX logic tied to real business rules like inventory limits and profile completeness for orders and reviews.

I’m now looking for an opportunity as a Junior Software Engineer, where I can learn from a strong team and grow.
