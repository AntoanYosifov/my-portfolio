Hi, I’m Antoan Yosifov—a backend-leaning software developer (Java/Spring) who cares about clean, readable code and reliable systems, and who’s actively growing into full-stack with Angular/TypeScript.

My projects show that arc. BrainDissecting was my first app: a server-side rendered Java/Spring site that integrates with the DOAJ API to surface and moderate scientific articles—no custom REST layer, just solid SSR and integration work. Then came TravelHub, my second app: an Angular + Firebase real-time app with auth, ownership rules, one-like-per-user, and a responsive, reactive UI. Same builder, broader stack.

I’m currently working full-time while studying in SoftUni (Bulgaria)’s 3-year Software Engineering Academy—a well-regarded, in-depth program in Europe—graduating December 2025. I’ve maintained full scores across modules, from fundamentals (what a variable is, how memory works, complexity basics) through OOP, SOLID, databases, testing, and architecture. In short: fundamentals first, craft second.

On the personal side, I’ve been living in Austria for 3 years, working full-time throughout. I’m actively improving my German, integrating here, and plan to build—and grow old—here.

I’m ready for my first professional developer role. Bring me a backlog and a codebase; I’ll bring focus, energy, and shipped features—with tests and documentation. (The “junior” is just the job title.)
